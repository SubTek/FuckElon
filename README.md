A custom IPA that removes the X branding while keeping the new like, retweet, etc. icons.

### Mention
I use this as my everyday Twitter client, so I will update it often *(with BHTwitter new releases and the latest stable version of X decrypted from the App Store)* and maybe add new tweaks while keeping our favorite bird.

![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/supercitron)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ghl3m0n/FuckElon)

## Features
- All X icons replaced with the Twitter bird.
- All X texts replaced with the old Twitter texts (Post --> Tweet, Repost --> Retweet, etc.).
- Includes the [BHTwitter](https://github.com/BandarHL/BHTwitter) tweak (injected by the [AppleFavour](https://applefavour.com/) Team).

## How does it work?
To maintain the classic look and feel of Twitter, some of the new design elements introduced by X have been replaced with those from earlier versions of Twitter. Specifically:
- **Icons**: The new icons from X have been substituted with the original Twitter bird icons.
- **Text Labels**: Text labels and button names that were changed in X have been reverted to their previous Twitter terminology (e.g., "Post" changed back to "Tweet", "Repost" reverted to "Retweet").
- **Interface Elements**: Certain interface elements that reflect the new X branding have been replaced with elements from the old Twitter design to preserve a nostalgic user experience.
