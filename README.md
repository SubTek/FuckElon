# FuckElon
A custom IPA that removes the X branding while keeping the new like, retweet, etc. icons.

### Mention
I use this as my everyday Twitter client, so I will update it often *(with BHTwitter new releases and the latest stable version of X decrypted from the App Store)* and maybe add new tweaks while keeping our favorite bird.

![X (formerly Twitter) Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/supercitron)
![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ghl3m0n/FuckElon)

## Features
- All X icons replaced with the Twitter bird.
- All X texts replaced with the old Twitter texts (Post --> Tweet, Repost --> Retweet, etc.).
- Includes the [BHTwitter](https://github.com/BandarHL/BHTwitter) tweak (injected by the [AppleFavour](https://applefavour.com/) Team).

## Installation
1. **Download the IPA**: [Download the latest version of FuckElon](https://github.com/ghl3m0n/FuckElon/releases).
2. **Install the IPA**: Use tools like [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) or [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) to sideload the IPA to your device. I recommand using [SideStore](https://sidestore.io/).
